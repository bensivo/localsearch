Features:
[x] Insert, Get Document
[x] Tokenize Document on Insert
[x] Create TF inverted index, update on Insert
[x] Query documents, using basic euclidean distance of TF vectors
[ ] Query documents, using BM25 ranking function
[ ] GRPC Gateway, so we can use HTTP to hit the grpc service
[ ] Basic UI for managing docs, querying docs
[ ] Performance / Stress testing
[ ] E2E Test suite, inside docker compose
[ ] Cranfield test suite, for evaluating doc ranking performance

Tech Debt:
[ ] refactoring: implement service layer, so we can invoke core functions directly without a GRPC controller
[ ] refactoring: use np.array for all vectors, instead of python lists
[ ] tf_index: implement better persistence, not just 1 giant JSON file
[ ] tf_index: batch writing results to file
[ ] tokenizer: try different options, different datasets, etc.
    - ngram tokenizers, so not entire word has to match
    - tokenizers for source code
    - different stemming algorithms

Additional Features:
[ ] InsertMany documents at once
